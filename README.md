<h1>My Ethical Hacking Road</h1>

<h2>I created this repo to document my ethical hacking journey and some of the tools I have gotten hands on with.</h2>

- Utilizing Nmap (netowrk mapper) to scan for open ports on the vulnerable Kioptrix machine. In the first image, I scanned for an individual port (111) which returned results that this port is running rcpbind and is open. In the second image, I changed the command to scan for all open ports on the machine and to also sniff out the OS details which can be seen as well.
